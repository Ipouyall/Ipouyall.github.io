About me
======
Hi!
I’m Pouya Sadeghi, 
a recent Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for making AI systems more reliable, safe, and inclusive.

My academic journey has centered around building intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also reliable and fair. 
I work at the intersection of large language models, multilingual NLP, and AI safety, with a strong interest in both theoretical insights and practical impact.

Looking ahead, 
I'm eager to build on this foundation by creating AI tools that not only push the boundaries of what machines can do, 
but also earn people’s confidence through transparency, reliability, and integrity. 
I’m driven by the goal of shaping technology that truly serves society.

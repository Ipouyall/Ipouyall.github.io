About me
======
Hi!
I am *Pouya Sadeghi*, a computer engineering B.Sc. student at the 
[Department of ECE](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}.

[//]: # (I have the pleasure of working with [Azadeh Shakery]&#40;https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery&#41;{:target="_blank"} and)

[//]: # ([Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh]&#40;https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/&#41;{:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am a visiting research student at )

[//]: # ([Singapore Management University &#40;SMU&#41;]&#40;https://www.smu.edu.sg/&#41;{:target="_blank"} working under the supervision of [Prof. Djordje Zikelic]&#40;https://djordjezikelic.github.io&#41;)

[//]: # (and a fellow at [Fatima Fellow]&#40;https://fatimafellow.com/&#41;{:target="_blank"}.)

Research Flavor
======

I am interested in doing research that can address real-world problems and provide practical solutions.
As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it raises important questions about safety, fairness, and trustworthiness.
My research aims to make AI systems safer, more trustworthy, more accessible, and to find ways to measure their fairness and reliability. 

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (LLMs are used in many applications today and have shown great promise in understanding and generating human language. )

[//]: # (However, challenges remain, particularly when it comes to biases, fairness, trustworthiness, and democratization, where these large models are not always accessible to everyone to use or do research.)

[//]: # (A major challenge is ensuring that these models work well for people from different languages and cultures. )
